My names Rob de Jager and I currently work as a cloud security researcher. I have a background in cloud infrastructure, devops and Linux systems administration. The majority of my research currently focusses on threat-actor behaviour in the cloud, for productization. Whenever I'm not working on research, I spend most of my time tinkering with side projects. The most fun of which are probably game modding and indie game developement.
